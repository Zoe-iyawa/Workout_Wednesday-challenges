# Workout_Wednesday-challenges
This project features my submissions for the Workout Wednesday challenges using Tableau. Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge to re-create a data-driven visualization. The challenges are designed to kick-start personal development in Tableau and Power BI.

Each Wednesday a challenges are released and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible.

## Dataset
